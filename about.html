      <h3>Selina</h3>

      <p>
        My name is Selina Chen and I have over 15 years of experience as a childcare professional. I have been
        a San Francisco native for over twenty years and am proud to have been able to serve my community by 
        educating children to become curious thinkers and upstanding citizens.
        My goal is to encourage and guide children to learn how to interact successfully with other children
        and adults, and to live together in a cooperative environment which promotes decision-making, peaceful
        resolution of conflicts, and respect and care for others. In doing so, I also hope to form a cooperative
        partnership with the parents so that we can work together to meet the needs of their children.
      </p>

      <h3>Raina</h3>

      <p>
        My name is Raina Mark and I also have over 15 years of childcare experience. I work primarily with
        meal planning and preparation to ensure each child has access to fresh, nutritious, and delicious food
        every day.
