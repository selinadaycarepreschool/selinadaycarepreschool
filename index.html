        Our family childcare is dedicated to providing a sound early childhood education for children 
        from the ages 0 through 5. We aim to provide a healthy, homelike, loving environment to meet the 
        social, emotional, physical, and intellectual needs of your growing child. Crucially, we 
        value and emphasize the qualities that make your child unique, and take great pride in giving
        the utmost respect and love to each child.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that childhood should be a time of joy, love, and exploration. We strive to provide a 
        children's curriculum that combines direction from the caregiver with the child's own interests.
        Our early childhood professionals work hard to plan a developmentally appropriate education that
        emphasizes hands-on experience to provide a foundation for learning and early literacy. Our goal
        is to foster their freedom of expression, growing independence, and positive self-esteem.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Ultimately, our childcare philosophy is based on flexibility and choice for each child. 
        We respect and accomodate the individual developmental levels of each child. We understand that
        each child is unique, and would never expect children to mold themselves to fit a prescribed plan for development. 
        Above all, we are here to provide a guiding and nurturing environment that encourages each child to explore
        the paths to fulfill their highest potential.

    <h3>Daycare Program</h3>

    <div>
      <p>
        Toddlers and two year-olds are active and eager learners. We structure our program to meet the changing
        needs of individual children by providing a safe and appropriate environment that is both intellectually challenging
        and creatively stimulating. Each day, the children enjoy both indoor and outdoor activities and can choose 
        from a wide variety of toys and equipment. Our staff will provide ample opportunities for children to explore and
        develop a wide range of gross/fine motor skills, self-help skills, and language skills. 
      </p>
  
      <h3>Preschool Program</h3>
      <p>
        For children in their preschool years (ages 3.5 to 5) the staff approaches education through an active 
        learning framework. Children are involved in discovery and hands-on activities to promote language 
        development, pre-math skills, creativity, and positive self-esteem.
  
        Furthermore, our staff approaches discipline in a positive manner with the goal of helping children learn self-control 
        and conflict resolution.

        We teach both programs in English, but incorporate Mandarin and Cantonese lessons in our curriculum to introduce
        and familiarize the children with other languages and cultures.
